# JenniferGreen_Mini-Data-Analysis
This repository is for the Mini Data Analysis project in Stat545A at UBC. There were two deliverables for this project.

In deliverable 1, I  explored 4 data sets and ultimately chose to work with *vancouver_trees*. I proposed 4 research questions that could be asked and answered when working with this data set. 

In deliverable 2, I narrowed down my 4 research questions into 2 and then tidyed up my data set to narrow in on these 2 research questions. I practiced working with factors, model fitting, and reading and writing data.

Clear instructions in addition to code chunk comments are included for every task. All of the libraries are loaded in at the beginning of each deliverable.
